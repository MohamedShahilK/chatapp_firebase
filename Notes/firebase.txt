Step 1 :
    Create a project in firebsae

Step 2 :
    Don't do anything and come back to vscode

Step 3 (Only Required Firebase CLI is not setup in our system. If already done, then skip this step): 
       [Only Once in a System, Not in every project.If Once setup is done, Skip this Step]

            Make sure install  (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli --> for reference) in your system by checking : 
                    "firebase --version"
            
                -> If firebase CLI is available, then type "firebase login".

                -> If firebase CLI is not available, then "sudo npm install -g firebase-tools" //sudo is important in this command
                    Then check "firebase --version".
                -> add add path in .bashrc file "export PATH="$PATH":"/home/mohamed/.npm-global/bin/firebase" (Optional)

Step 4 (Only Required flutterfire_cli is not setup in our system. If already done, then skip this step): 

    run - "dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli" 

    add add path in .bashrc fil "export PATH="$PATH":"/home/mohamed/.pub-cache/bin""

    run for checking install is done- "flutterfire --version"

Step 5 : 
    Move to project directory if you are not there.Then configure our project with firebase project by typing:
        "flutterfire configure"
    This command bring all projects in our firebase account and we can select the required one.


Note : 
        
        1. "google-services.json" will automatically download and save on andriod/app directory for andriod and also for other platforms in their appropriate folders
        2. "build.gradle" will automatically configured too
